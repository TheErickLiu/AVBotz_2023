    "On Wikipedia, I found lots of good models to figure out where to start, mainly [Angle of View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I need to find the distance of the lens to the object. This can by found by dividing the Y dimension of the image in meters by the tangent of half of the vertical field of view. To find the offset, I need to translate all of the coordinates in the image to meters. Afterwards, it can be found by subtracting the object center  by the image center coordinates. To calculate the yaw and pitch, I use the inverse tangent of the offset divided by the distance to find the angle.\n",

    "From the model below, I have derived the formulas needed to get the distance, offsets, and yaw and pitch. "
