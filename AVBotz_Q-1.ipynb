    "To find the center and orientation of the object, I needed to identify the object in the image and locate the center's coordinates and what direction it was pointing in. First, I would use a color mask to filter out every color except the color of the object. In addition, I took a look at OpenCV's [cascade classfier](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-detect-objects-in-real-time-using-opencv-and-python-c1ba0c2c69c0) and the superior deep learning model [YOLOv5](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/detecting-objects-with-yolov5-opencv-python-and-c-c7cf13d1483c). Using object detection by shape would be the ideal solution, but I would not do this for a multitude of reasons; there is no pre-trained model for the pathmarker, the amount of work needed to implement this is not worth the results, and the color mask returned reasonably good result. Second, I would use Open CV object detection with contours to find the object's center and orientation."

    "Finding how to make a color mask was quite simple; I just had to search up some example code. I found [Color Filtering OpenCV Python Tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/color-filter-python-opencv-tutorial/) to be quite helpful. There was some difficulty in finding the HSV value for the bounds, but I found a [StackOverflow conversation ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10948589/choosing-the-correct-upper-and-lower-hsv-boundaries-for-color-detection-withcv)that help out with my predicament. Next was finding the largest contour with the matching color in the image, which should be the object. To help with determining the real orientation of the object, I looked at [How to Determine the Orientation of an Object Using OpenCV. ](https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-determine-the-orientation-of-an-object-using-opencv/)"
